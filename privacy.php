				<center><h1>Privacy</h1></center>
				</br>
		<p>Employeemasterdatabase.com’s (EMBD) prime mission is to protect the security and privacy of the personal information submitted by our users. By helping our users understand how their information is handled, we want to assure them that they can use our website with confidence and EMDB is committed to transparency across all the processes.  </p>
<p>
This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. </p>
<p>Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?</h3>
<p>We collect two types of information about you when you visit our website: PII and non-personal, aggregate information (such as information regarding the pages on our Site that you have visited and your IP address).
</p>
<h3  style="color:#0AB5DC">Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, citizenship / visa status, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, or company name. We collect and store the personal information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect your personal information on the website:
<ul>
  <li>As part of your registration as a job seeker on the website;</li>
    <li>As part of your registration as a recruiter on the website;</li>
	  <li>As part of entering and participating in contests and promotions;</li>
	    <li>When you use services or tools on the website including "Forward this to a Friend" or referral features;</li>
		  <li>When you submit information for editorial purposes including news items, press releases, or other items of interest;</li>
		    <li>When you submit comments on the website’s feedback page;</li>
			 <li>When you contact us for assistance through our 24/7 Support Center;</li>
 			  <li>When your name, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number are referred by another recruiter, employer, job seeker; </li>
		       <li>When you are register for events or conferences.</li>  
  </ul>
The above list provides an example of the personal information that may be collected by employeemasterdatabase.com. From time to time, we may collect personal information from you in other ways that are not described above. If you do not want us to collect your personal information, please do not provide it to us. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the PII that you submit to employeemasterdatabase.com. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using our website and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">How do we use your information?</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the website and a description of how this information is used:

</p>
<p><b>Internet Protocol (IP) Address:</b>  Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data. We use this information to deliver our website to you upon request, to tailor our website to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our website.</p>
<p><b>Web Beacons:</b> "Web Beacons" (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the website and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.</p>
<p>We also may collect non-personally identifiable information from you in order to customize your experience, fulfill your requests for information, and improve our services. We may provide this non-personally identifiable information to third parties. For example, we might inform third parties about the number of users of our website and the activities they conduct while on the website. We also may provide trusted partners with general information regarding our users and visitors.</p>
<p>We may use the information collected from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>To personalize user's experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
<li>To improve our website in order to serve you better.</li>
<li>To allow us to respond to your customer service requests in an efficient way.</li>
<li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</li>
<li>To send periodic e-mails if subscribed with us. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">Do we use 'cookies'?</h3>
<p>We use cookies for tracking purposes.</p>
<p>Cookie: A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer’s hard disk that may be used to collect information about your activity on the website. For example, when someone visits a page within the website, a cookie is placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the website previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our website.</p>
<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
<p>If you disable cookies off, some features will be disabled that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>
<p>However, you can still place orders.</p>

<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">Change in Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change by sending a notice to the primary e-mail address specified by you, placing a notification on the website login screen, or by placing a prominent notice on the website.</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">How do we protect visitor information?</h3>
<p>Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.</p>
<p>We use regular Malware Scanning.</p>
<p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p><p>We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
<p>
For your convenience we may store your credit card information longer than 30 days in order to expedite future orders, and to automate the billing process.
</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">Third Party Disclosure</h3>
<p>We do sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your PII to outside parties.</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">Third party links</h3>
<p>We do include or offer third party products or services on our website.</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">Google</h3>
<p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. </p>

<p>https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en </p>
<p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>
<p>Google, a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>



<p>We have implemented the following:
<ul>
  <li>Remarketing with Google AdSense</li>
<li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
<li>Demographics and Interests Reporting</li>
<li>DoubleClick Platform Integration</li>
</ul>
We along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.</P>

<p><b>Opting out:</b>
Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf </a>
</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
<li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
<li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
<li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:
<ul>
<li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Users will be able to change their personal information:
<ul>
<li>By e-mailing us</li>
<li>By logging in to their account</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">How does our site handle do not track signals?</h3>
<p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h3>
<p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>
<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">Fair Information Practices</h3>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<p>

<p><b>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</b>


<ul><li>Within 1 business day</li>
<li>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only those individuals who have enforceable rights against data users, but also individuals who have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
</li>
</ul></p>

<h3   style="color:#0AB5DC">CAN SPAM Act</h3>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial e-mail, establishes requirements for commercial messages and gives recipients the right to have e-mails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
