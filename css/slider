                      <h2><center>HOW IT WORKS</center></h2>
           
  <p style="line-height:28px;margin:20px 0px">Upon registering with EMDB, the candidates are assigned with an unique EMDB ID against which they update their availability status. The same ID is also mentioned on the profiles that they uploaded into the EMDB system. When recruiters get access to a desired profile from EMDB, they can use the EMDB ID mentioned on it to track the availability status of the candidate. This avoids the need to connect with the unavailable candidates and saves valuable time of the recruiters that can be further utilized on screening available candidates.</p>
				 
<!-- <p class="last_para">Job seeker can create a profile by registering to this website. Once registered you will receive an unique EMDB ID. Complete your profile and set your availability. Just copy paste your EMDB to any resume you create, your availability will get embedded in that resume. if you want to change your availability, just change it only in this website, the embed code in the resume will bear your latest availability setting.</p> -->
